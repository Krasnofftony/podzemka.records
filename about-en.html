Hear us out. YOUR MUSIC HAS TO BE OUTSTANDING!</p>
                    <p class="about__text">In Pidzemka we neither have customers noк take orders. We collaborate with artists to create phenomenal pieces. Together, we enjoy the ride just as much as we are proud of our releases. Moreover, once you come to Pidzemka, you are likely to end up in a whole new world of imagery and creativity with a completely lost track of time.
                    <p class="about__text">To help you dive right into your inner self, music and ideas, the studio is equipped with two soundproof and noise-absorbant rooms. A smaller one is most commonly used for recording vocals and therefore is referred to as a Vocal Booth. Another room (Control Room) is larger and staffed with all the gear imaginable for professional recording, mixing and practice.

                        <p class="team-card__bio">Regardless of your skills, there’s always a moment when you catch yourself thinking “I’ve tried it all, yet there is no bite to the track yet”. And that’s exactly the moment you should approach Bohdan. Bohdan has been involved into sound crafting for over 10 years by now. He is capable of mixing live shows, mastering studio tapes or even run a field recording. That’s not it however. He can also write arrangements equally well for a rock band as well as ambient soundtracks for a motion picture. That’s why we are certain that you’d be able to hit it off right from the start.
